"2,800",Help me stay #unstoppable with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,21,"My name is Julia and even though I was born with cerebral palsy it
  is not usually a way I ever describe myself. Growing up I did not put
  limits on myself and what I could or could not do. I always tried if
  it was something I wanted to do I tried and tried again. Sometimes it
  didn’t work out but most times, I could figure out a way to get things
  done. As I’ve become an adult I’m not as strong as I once was, but I
  have yet to give up my “unstoppable” spirit. Throughout the years I
  have found different ways to help myself stay independent and mobile.
  These have included surgeries, and therapy, a wheelchair, and my
  greatest blessing; a beautiful Mobility service dog named Hope. Read more about Hope and I
    here Although these have all been things that have changed my life for the
  better,  I still struggle with daily tasks. One of the best things
  about my wheelchair is that I can get out and go places without
  overexerting myself, but one of the worst things about my wheelchair
  is, I still need to ask for assistance more often than I would like
  because things are often out of reach  and I do worry that I am losing
  what little strength I do have in my legs when using my chair.  The
  day I was browsing online and an ad for the Alinker walking bike came
  up I thought to myself that is really cool and I shared it so other
  people could see it too, but  when I went back and started reading
  about it I realized that not only would it be good for other people,
  But it could be an excellent tool for ME! Not only would I be more
  upright and able to do more things on my own I would also be able to
  stay active and use my legs without completely exhausting myself.
  Since I’ve been keeping up with the Alinker, I’ve noticed one really
  interesting thing when you see it out somewhere , you don’t
  immediately think oh look a poor disabled person but rather oh that’s
  cool I wonder where they got it? I would like to thank anyone who is
  considering making a donation to any of the #Alinker campaigns and
  helping everyone with their  continuing mobility and independence ! # Independence #alinker #alinkerwalkingbike #letsroll #keepmoving

"2,002",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,29,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1
"5,705",Support Urban Care's Community Healthcare,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,30,"At Urban Care Clinic our vision is to make quality healthcare
    accessible to everyone. In order to achieve that goal, we have made
    our services available to surrounding communities free of charge,
    who would otherwise not be able to afford that and would have no
    equivalent alternative. We started small and in the past months we
    could extend our range of services and availability to 3 days per
    week, where we are treating patients free of charge. At the moment,
    every week we are seeing and treating up to 60 patients for free,
    which amounts to 250-300 patients per month. We are usually financing these activities from an allocated
    percentage of our monthly turnover. As we are heavily affected by
    COVID as well with a significant reduction in paying patients and
    left with a growing number of patients with little financial means,
    we are reaching out to you. We want to continue this vital service.
    It has become an important part of our communities in Nyamanzi and
    Dimani, we have chronically ill patients relying on this. Anticipating that tourism will slowly start to recover earliest
    by end of the year / beginning of 2021, we want to ensure that we
    can continue to make our healthcare services available to everyone,
    throughout this time. An average of USD20 is used per patient for exams, treatments
    and interventions. You can choose to contribute once or opt for a recurring monthly
    contribution. You have the choice between funding the treatment of 1
    patient or multiple. If you are not able to contribute financially
    at the moment, you can support us by sharing the campaign in your network! Along the time this campaign will run, we will keep updating you
    about our patients (with their consent) and how your money has been used. Please help us to keep quality healthcare accessible to everyone.",https://fundrazr.com/UC-outreach
"4,801",Help Leewana heal -- get her back in action!,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.5k goal,104,"I must fight with all my strength so that the little positive
      things that my health allows me to do might be pointed toward
      helping the revolution. The only real reason for living. - Frida Kahlo *** Hey there! Wow. I didn’t realize how difficult this would be to write. I
    believe that we strengthen our communities and fight tyranny when we
    lift each other up. But it’s still not easy to admit that while I am
    fortunate and privileged in so many ways, I, Leewana, your friend,
    comrade, and co-conspirator, have a debilitating health condition.
    It’s even harder to add that because I want so desperately to be
    back in the trenches with you, I’m asking for your help. Ack, vulnerability! What’s going on? In case you don’t want to read the whole story... I have been
      suffering from debilitating migraines for the last year and would
      appreciate any help you can offer. You can donate once now, or
      choose a recurring donation that will last ONLY for the next four months . I have
      no preference, it's whatever works for you. If you want more detail, read on! For a little over a year, I’ve had a migraine almost every day. I started getting periodic migraines when I was 13 -- not fun,
    but manageable. Then last May, I flew backwards on a bus and got a
    concussion. My doctors think that it “triggered my pain systems,”
    and are hard at work to identify possible underlying conditions. All I know for sure is that it changed everything. Because migraines aren’t “visible,” it can be easy to diminish
    their impact. But the World Health Organization rates them as the 6th most debilitating health condition overall, and they take top honors among neurological conditions. This is a useful article about
      the full impact of migraine, from mental fuzziness to excruciating pain. For me, some days it’s “just” a headache. Those are among the
    days that I might be able to muster up energy to socialize or go to
    a meeting. But too often, my head throbs, I can’t stand, I feel dizzy,
    I’m nauseous, and all I can do is lie down in a dark room. In my darkest moments, it feels like migraines have completely
    taken over my life, and I doubt whether I’ll be able to do things
    like exercise, work full time, or socialize in groups ever again. I
    don’t think it’s a coincidence that migraines are strongly linked to
    depression and other mood disorders. I’ve become another medical debt sob story. In the initial aftermath of my concussion, I never imagined that
    I would still be in chronic pain over a year later. And when I was
    forced to stop working altogether in January, I had no idea that
    solving my headaches could take this much time, energy, and resources. I’ve tried remedies across the spectrum of Eastern and Western
    medicine, from acupuncture to magnesium to Botox. Unfortunately
    since the scientific community knows so little about migraines, most
    treatment plans are based on trial and error. By committing to put the necessary effort into feeling better,
    I’ve taken on a crippling amount of medical debt. Oh, the places I’d go without migraines holding me back. My medical debt is suffocating. But the hardest part of this
    ordeal is being forced to sit still for days, weeks, and months when
    there is so much work to do. I’m happy when I’m dancing with dear
    friends. I’m happy when I have enough energy to support my loved
    ones like they deserve. I am happiest fighting for a better world alongside all of you. I’ve been fortunate throughout the years to be surrounded by
    inspiring visionaries and doers. Over and over I’ve seen that righteously angry people can hack away at the seemingly inescapable power of the big banks, retail
    giants, a white supremacist government, and anything else they throw
    at us. I never dreamed that I would be forced to take such tremendous
    steps back from my work in the movement , from close friends, and also from many of the simple pleasures
    I enjoy in life. It’s been discouraging, but I am holding out hope
    that I can feel enough like myself again to get back to imagining
    and creating a more hopeful future for all of us. I am DETERMINED to get better. Like Frida, a fellow chronic pain sufferer, I am going to “ fight with all my strength” so that what “my health allows me to
    do might be pointed toward helping the revolution.” I’ve been trying
    to stay engaged in the struggle in small ways, and over the next few
    weeks I’m going to experiment with reconnecting with the work in a
    more part-time capacity. I hope that my contributions can get bigger
    and bigger as I continue treatment. A nd once I’m back, I intend to fight so that nobody else has to have the
      experience of choosing between financial security and health. There is some good news… In the past two months, I’ve developed a relationship with a
    leading neurologist and researcher at Mayo Clinic. It’s been refreshing to experience Mayo’s model of integrative
    health, and talk to doctors who can actually give me the time I
    need. With their support, I’m hoping to continue experimenting with
    new and unusual remedies to see what offers relief. Among these are CGRP inhibitor shots, Trigeminal Nerve devices,
    and transcranial magnetic stimulation. It’s too early for me to give
    out too much information without jinxing it… but Mayo doctors may
    have also found an underlying condition making my headaches worse.
    Fingers crossed! And now for the hard part … going beyond typical methods (which
    haven’t worked for me), and visiting top-notch medical institutions
    (when others can’t give me what I need) costs a lot of money. I’m
    lucky to have gotten support from my family, but we are at the end
    of our means. In order to continue down these treatment paths, and
    hopefully ultimately get relief, I need some kind of miracle. That’s why I’m reaching out to my beloved community. Because of insurance compatibility issues, the CGRP-inhibitor
    shot costs $650 per month. A “Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation” or
    “Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation” Device totals around $500, or
    $250 / month, depending on which I use. Continued visits to Mayo
    Clinic cost $400 - $500 each. And as mentioned above, I’ve
    accumulated thousands in medical debt over the last year. I’m not asking to cover my living costs, or even my entire
    medical costs. But any small dent you can help put in this sum,
    which totals from $800 - $1500 per month, is deeply felt. You can either donate in one chunk, or choose the option
        to spread it out over the next 4 months. All donations will go directly towards the medical costs I
    outlined above, or towards paying off prior medical debt. I am
    making it possible to donate on a recurring basis because some
    friends shared that they would like the option to spread out their
    donation over a few months... Do whatever feels best to you! My goal is to use this boost to dive into new treatments,
    and level out my costs as I discover what works. I will keep you
    consistently updated, and you can rescind a donation at any time. Without your help, I’m stuck, but with it, I know that I can
    continue on my path towards healing. Thank you. One thing I have taken away from this ordeal is a consistent
    gratitude practice. Even if I haven’t spoken to you in a while,
    chances are I’m thinking of you often as I consider circumstances,
    experiences, and people for which I am thankful. You’ve taught me the power of compassionate acts, and I hope
    you know that the next time you’re in need I want to be the first
    person you approach for support. Thank you for reading this far and for considering my requests,
    even as there are infinite worthy causes. Please don’t hesitate to
    contact me with questions, comments, poetry, kind words, etc :)
    Peace, love, & solidarity forever!",https://fundrazr.com/helpleewana

  Walking Bike. I'm a single Dad and would love to be able to enjoy the
  outdoors again with my daughter and friends. Diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at age 2, I spent most of my
  youth in and out of a wheelchair and in and out of hospitals. After
  many years and total joint replacements in both hips and knees, I
  became more mobile and began participating in outdoor activities with
  the assistance of several local non-profit groups that assist the
  disabled in the participation of sports such as hiking, kayaking,
  sailing and more. However, in early 2018, I had to have a second knee replacement (on
  the same knee) and later that year, I fell and since then, I have not
  been able to walk without assistance.  I currently use crutches
  outside and a walker in the home.  I have not participated in any
  outdoor activities for over a year. I no longer go for walks, regular
  grocery shopping, go to malls or other public venues.  Walking with
  crutches while having Rheumatoid Arthritis causes added pain in my
  back, neck and shoulders.  This pain along with an overall fear of
  falling prevents me from going out, enjoying the great outdoors in New
  England and being socially active as I had been before the knee
  replacement and subsequent fall. I attend Physical Therapy several
  days a week and am trying to get some strength back. The #Alinker is a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people
  stay active and live life to the fullest allowing users experience
  chronic aches and pains, chronic illnesses and recovering from an
  injury, they can all still be active! Currently, Health Insurance
  plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility devices and that’s
  why campaigns like this are so important. I'd be able to rebuild and
  maintain muscle tone in my legs, be able to walk upright instead of
  using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall and once again
  enjoy my time outdoors and with family and friends without the feeling
  like I'm slowing everyone down. It may even allow me to return to
  scuba diving as I'd be able to use the #Alinker to walk the trail down
  to the water's edge at Ft. Wetherill park in Jamestown, RI.  to It

    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,

  interpretation . Results are uploaded via our
  participant website, which you will get access to once you register
  your kit. It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our

"1,946,157",American Gut,,,,,"We are currently not able to supply any of our regular
    collection kits. Any general contributions made using the orange
      ""Contribute"" button will be counted only as a donation,
      not as an exchange for a kit. The Microsetta Initiative and its
  subsidiaries, including the American Gut Project, have pivoted to
  COVID-19 research and are revising our kits to support this effort. We
  are working as hard as we can, but please be patient as these changes
  have required a complete overhaul of our infrastructure.  If you are
  interested in these kits, please fill out this sign up form and we
  will be sending you updates on kit availability : https://mailchi.mp/ucsd/microsettakitinterest In addition, we are in urgent need of funding to support these
    research endeavors. We are part of the UC San Diego School of
    Medicine. We are actively working with frontline workers, sharing
    limited resources, and engaged with the broader San Diego research
    network studying all aspects of this virus and disease. Please
    consider making a donation directly: https://go.ucsd.edu/2QlTi8n More information about these recent changes
  can be found in the UC San Diego News: https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/call-for-citizen-scientists-to-contribute-to-covid-19-studies ____________________________________________________________________________________________ The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with the mission of
    collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data from
    populations across the globe. The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if
    you would like to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed
    as a perk, email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS or FedEx within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go
      out. If you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit
      will not be sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere Else: International participants are also welcome to join. An
    additional $25 international shipping fee also
    applies (which you would add as an additional contribution
  after claiming a perk), along with other regulations . I f you
    do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be sent out
    until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in
  the U.S. from some locations can be expensive , so it is
    recommended that you look into the cost of return shipping (it is
    highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes significantly longer (6+ months)
      to receive results if you submit one of the following sample
      types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that
    the Fundrazr transaction fee will be deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you
      must agree to use an electronic format for your signature in
      accordance with the United States' eSIGN Act and California's UETA

"1,020",Healthy Snack Workshop,U.S. Dollar,,of $999 goal,16,"Hi, I am Ms. Kellogg, the 6th grade math, science, and health teacher
  at Raleigh Hills. Our health class wants to host a 3 day workshop
  meant to inspire and inform teenagers about preparing their own
  snacks. The 3 day workshop will be led by Beth Gates who has been
  involved with promoting cooking and teaching cooking classes to teens
  for over 8 years in the Portland area. Each day she will bring a new
  recipe for the students to make themselves: quick pickles, smoothies,
  and fancy toast. The goal is that students will have the knowledge to
  prepare snacks that are: delicious, affordable, nutritious , and are
  informed by sustainable practices (low packaging etc) Students will be
  eating the food they prepare as well as collecting recipes, and taking
  home their own pickles. They will also be given instruction on what it
  means to shop within a growing season and using seasonal fruits and
  vegetables. As sixth graders, many students are now home alone after
  school and are preparing snacks, if not meals, for themselves. I feel
  it is important to empower them to make informed choices about the
  food they eat. Last year, Beth taught a one “smoothie” making
    lesson to our 6th grade students and it was described as a highlight
    of the year by the kids. Beth Gates is part of the CookFirst Collective. The mission of
    the collective is to cultivate home cooking, cooking with
    ingredients “on-hand” or seasonably available, and to inspire risk
    taking in the kitchen. Beth has taught youth cooking classes both as
    after school programs in PPS middle schools as well as Saturday
    Academy courses through PCC. Last year Beth taught a one “smoothie”
    making lesson to our 6th grade students and it was described as a

135,Help Patty With Double Lung Transplant Expenses,,,,,"Hi my name is Steve Olivieri I'm the pastor of Cornerstone Fellowship of Mill Run Who: I wanted to tell you about a sweet lady named
  I've gotten to know named Patty Brandt who
  really needs your help. What: Patty is on the waiting list for a double lung
  transplant! This is an incredible answer to prayer. Back Story: Patty Brandt has end stage severe
  Emphysema and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). For those
  of you who aren't medically minded, her lungs only work a fraction of
  how they're suppose to work. She has such a hard time breathing she
  needs on oxygen all day every day just to breath. Even while on oxygen
  she can only walk a short distance before she needs to stop and catch
  her breath. Patty underwent tons of tests and exams under the care of the Lung
  Transplant team of physicans at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in
  Pittsburgh, PA. She has been told she will be placed on the lung
  transplant list as long as she get some minor dental work and gains
  10lbs by December 1st. *She has been given the ok by the transplant team to begin
      fundraising to cover the cost of the transplant and follow-up care. Why is Patty fundraising? Isn't this type of thing covered by health Insurance? Even if you have insurance, there are out of pocket expenses
    associated with the transplanted and continued follow up care.
    Expenses include but are not limited to: Co-pays for medications and office visits (this
    alone will be $1,000's/month) Insurance premiums and deductibles Transportation costs and parking related costs Lodging and meals Even with Medicare, the out of pocket expenses related to getting a     double lung transplant will cost tens of thousands of dollars. Why consider helping Patty? Patty is not a perfect person and no one is, but there is one person
  who is rooting harder than anyone else for Patty. Her name is Kayla.
  She is the biological granddaughter of Patty and her husband Rick.
  Kayla's dad passed away and her mother was unable to care for Kayla.
  Not wanting to see their granddaughter enter into foster care, Patty
  and Rick legally adopted their granddaughter Kayla. They opened up
  their home and changed Kayla's life for the better. Patty made a promise to Kayla that she would see her through
  graduation if not longer. Why support Patty? So Patty can keep her promise to Kayla!! Please consider helping Patty pay their medical bills and continue to
  take care of thier granddaughter whom they love with their whole heart! This is where YOU come in: Give a one time tax
  deductible donation of $3, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 or whatever
  God tugs on your heart strings to give. *All donations are secure via paypal. 100% of the donated amount goes
  directly to Patty and her family to cover expenses related to her
  transplant and follow up care. If you have any questions or for more info: - Please email Pastor Steve Olivieri of Cornerstone

350,Kids in Venezuela need your help,Canadian Dollar,,of $4k goal,12,"Angels for Humanitarian Aid is a Canadian non-profit
  organization for international cooperation presided by me Carlos
  Andres Bromley, who aims to help needy communities in the areas of
  health and education Check Our Web site to see what we do. We are raising this money to help the kids at the JM de los Rios
    hospital in Venezuela, who need Hemodialysis catheters to be able to
    survive while following the Dialysis treatment.   As you can see
    below we have already provide one catheter to the hospital for Daniel Laya a 1
    year old kid and we have bought a second one for Greiber Cuences a 7
    years old kid, which is on his way to Venezuela. We have contact with the Nephrology department of the hospital
    to make sure the appropiate catheters are found depending on the
    specific cases received at the hospital, and we make sure this
    devices are given to the appropiate people, thanks to our
    ambassadors located in Venezuela. Please ser the second catheter donated to the hospital Please see the history below to have an idea of what is the
    current situation at this hospital. The information below has been
    retrieved from the following article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/25/inside-venezuelas-top-childrens-medical-unit-where-patients-are/ “ This is dangerous for you and for me. There’s a real climate of
    fear”, says the doctor as he sits nervously in a room off intensive
    care at the JM de Los Rios Children’s Hospital in Caracas. Dr Huniades Urbina is trying to expose the desperate shortage of
    drugs and medical supplies in what should be the best equipped
    paediatric unit in Venezuela, but he is taking a great risk. Huge numbers of medicines are now hard or impossible to find,
    from antibiotics and painkillers to anti-epilepsy and chemotherapy drugs. D r Urbina says the unit has gone back to methods and medications
    used decades ago, because of the shortages. Where once they had
    state of the art chemotherapy for cancer patients he says they now
    have to make do with lesser options. “Sometimes people die because
    of these shortages, even here in the best children’s intensive care
    unit in Venezuela”, he says Testing kits for blood and other disposables are also scarce.
    The hospital has taken to boiling and reusing items that are
    supposed to be for single-use. When challenged on the dangers of
    this Dr Urbina’s junior colleague Dr Alvarez agrees but says they
    have no choice” The intensive care unit is operating with a reduced number of
    beds. That is partly due to the shortages of supplies, and also
    because of the shortage of doctors. Around 10,000 are estimated to
    have left the country in recent years. “ We do our best to help because this is what makes sense
      to do in cases like this.",https://fundrazr.com/jmdelosrios

  it , and the people who is surround. Due to this pathology,
  the routine, habits and custom of the child and the family, are
  strongly altered. Chemonkey is a project for kids who are living chemotherapy process,
  during the investigation, we realized that there wasn't any
    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will
  help. Whether you can give or not, please share this widely with
  friends on facebook, twitter, e-mail, or any other social media. The more people who see this project, more kids will be
  happy - developing physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and
  social strength in the kids who receive this kit. The monkey hangs in their neck and chest, so it protects their port.",https://fundrazr.com/chemonkey
135,Cannabis Therapeutics Certification,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,7,"This year we are celebrating 15 years since the American
    Alliance for Medical Cannabis was founded. Dr. Jay Cavanaugh created
    AAMC to help patients and to educate health professionals, lawmakers

    have come a long way since 2001. We now have AAMC Directors in 21
    States, and 26 States plus the District of Columbia have legal
    medical marijuana. The most common question patients ask is “Where can I find a
    doctor who can help me?” Most doctors have not had a chance to learn
    about medical cannabis. They didn’t learn about the endocannabinoid
    system in medical school and they are reluctant to talk about it. The American Alliance for Medical Cannabis is dedicated to
    helping patients. We need your support to increase our staff so that
    we can identify qualified health professionals and provide patients
    with quality medical care. By becoming AAMC certified clinics, health professionals will
    demonstrate that they are informed about the therapeutic use of
    Cannabis. AAMC is trusted by patients. We understand the needs of
    patients. Patients will know that they are being cared for by
    competent doctors. Patients have the right to talk about their use
    of Cannabis with people who know that it’s not just for fun. Our goal is to develop clinics where patients can get complete
    medical care from doctors who know how Cannabis helps. If you would
    like to help, please give AAMC a generous donation today. AAMC certified clinics provide: * Knowledgeable doctors and nurses * Cannabis is part of initial treatment plan when indicated. * Clinics are typical doctor's offices * Full service health care The goal is to develop clinics that have knowledgeable staff to

  nature of our gym and stage situation, we are unable to use a
  projector set-up because the chords would be a tripping hazard to
  students. We also would like to use a projector during the morning
  times to get the kids moving several days a week before classes begin. Therefore a rear facing projector screen with an Apple TV hooked up
  to the projector would be an amazing addition to our Physical
  Education program as well as a helpful tool for the whole school to
  use every day.  We would have a projector set-up behind the rear
  screen on the stage so no chords would be on the gym floor. We have
  access to iPads that we would airplay through the Apple TV onto the

  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679

  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe
  haven where they can break the cycle of poverty. All donations go
  directly to medical cost and does not cover any administration fees.
  We have never needed as much support as we are asking for this year.
  Any and all help is greatly appreciated! Please consider a donation by

500,It all started with a Ray......,U.S. Dollar,,of $400 goal,12,"It all started with A Ray.... and together we can make many more shine.... This all started with a Ray, our Ray, to be more accurate. My
      good friend, Claudia and I, had just moved her mountain Boutique
      to a new location and it needed a new fresh look. She brought in
      Ray, probably the gentlest and sweetest soul, to do the job.
      ""You pick it, I paint it"" he would say each day he came
      in. What I didn't know was that he wasn't just using a catchy
      slogan.  Over the week he spent with us I came to find our Ray is
      color blind and has been for the 76 years he has been on this
      wonderful world. Ray never had an opinion on the colors or chose
      them himself because he could not see the shades as we did. As I watched him carefully tape off the corners and windows
      and gentle apply the mint green and merlot red to our walls I
      realized that Ray would never be able to see how truly beautiful
      his work was. In between stories of his rowdy youth and extra
      coats of paint on the walls it dawned on me that Claudia and I
      could do something special for Ray to help say thank you for all
      his work.... EnChroma Glasses! So, I went online and started
    harassing all my friends and neighbors. SURELY! SOMEONE had to have
    a pair of those fancy glasses we could borrow. In my search a
    community member mentioned that there must be many more in our
    community that could benefit. The decision to start a fund for a
    permanent publicly available pair was made. All we needed to do was
    find a home where people could access them. Luckily, we didn't have
    to look far. Neighbor to the Boutique is Wild Bear Nature Center,
    Boulder County's only all ages, non-profit nature center. WILD BEAR NATURE CENTER Wild Bear Nature Center sees about
    27,000 visitors through its door every year. With a passion for
    re-connecting all ages with Nature as well as educating the
    importance of taking care of this beautiful earth, we believe that
    this is the home for our Enchroma glasses. THE PERFECT HOME.
    Utilizing Wild Bears ability to direct people to nature hikes, snow
    shoeing or one of their superb programs, we can create exceptionally
    magical mountain moments for Color Deficient seers that will last a
    life time. Imagine the oranges and reds of the Aspens to an eight
    year old who has never seen those shades before. Or imagine seeing
    the deep hues of our back country for the very first time for
    someone who has spent their whole lives in the Rockies. All the funds collected will be
      used to purchase a pair of EnChroma glasses that will be available
      for any one with Color Deficiency to rent free of charge. Any
      remaining funds will be used to make an exhibit for the center
      explaining Color Deficiency and Blindness as well as educating
      visitors how other animals see color. And of course we will have a
      special night with Ray, the reason this all started. Thank you for spending the time to
    read our story. We greatly appreciate any and all donations. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/21SXlb
"2,929",Help me #keepmoving with an Alinker walking bike,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,26,"When I was diagnosed with Relapsing MS in 2002, my work was in
    the inside-front pages of top fashion magazines. I was the Art
    Director for Estée Lauder’s global advertising. Shortly, I was
    recruited by Starwood Hotels & Resorts where as Creative
    Director, I traveled the world, directing lifestyle and
    architectural photo shoots. MS symptoms have changed my abilities to do some of the things I
    love but my artistic vision and creative curiosity have only
    transitioned in new directions—a decade and a half after my first MS
    symptom I am writing and illustrating a children’s book, learning to
    horse back ride through equine therapy, swimming laps at the YMCA,
    tracing my Irish/French ancestry, blogging about cooking, recipes,
    collected during my travels and teaming with other creatives,
    developing marketing for non-profits—pro bono, like GallopNYC,
    therapeutic horsemanship. The Alinker is a non-motorized walking bike without pedals. I
    can continue to be active, be included and move around in a very

  my family, do my groceries myself, leave the house alone for the first
  time (I might be reaching but I can hope right? ). All funds raised
  will go to purchasing the Alinker. Please donate. Any amount can help

  the doctors and staff of Emerald Park Eye Care (EPEC) and we are
  committed to caring for the eye health of those in the community. We
  are especially excited to raise money for Optometry Giving Sight and
  expanding our reach to less-fortunate people around the world. And, we
  are SO EXCITED to raise funds in this format - we love games and challenges!!! Optometry Giving Sight is a charity that provides eye exams and
  glasses for people who do not otherwise have access to care. Their
  slogan is ""transforming lives through the gift of vision"" -
  and we can't think of a more worthy cause!  Each year we participate
  in their fundraising campaign in October (Vision Health Month), and
  thought that this year we would enhance our efforts and do some early
  fundraising in August as well! We are lucky enough to see every day what a difference eye exams and
  glasses can make for our patients, and being able to spread this
  privilege throughout the world is truly a gift. Imagine a world
  without glasses - many children and adults throughout the world don't
  have to imagine it as it is their reality. The funds raised by this
  charity truly make a difference. Please donate to our EPEC team and this very worthy cause! Thanks! Team EPEC",https://fundrazr.com/31XUGd
"2,800",Help Bre #keepmoving & maintain their independence with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,35,"Hey friends! Okay, so... I'm Bre. I'm 28 years old. I'm a lover of the
    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,
      open up my world again, and change my life. Thank you for your consideration and support ♥",https://fundrazr.com/f1VtI8

  bike. Thanks for taking a second to check out this amazing device. It
  is changing lives for all kinds of individuals, in particular, those
  with mobility challenges...like me. I’m here because mobility challenges suck! #selmablair #keepmoving #alinker #alinkerfamily Here in Halifax Nova Scotia Canada, the outdoors is the place to be!
  The Alinker is my ticket to inclusion, mobility, fitness & independence. When I am unstable mobility wise (in a flare) I feel vulnerable and
  nervous to go out. The Alinker will change that for me. The Alinker is definitely the right choice for my lifestyle. It’s a humbling experience asking for financial support. Helping to
  purchase the Alinker Is exactly what I’m asking support for. Currently Medical plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility
  devices and that’s why campaigns like this are so important.
